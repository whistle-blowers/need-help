# My name is Khan
I am not a terrorist. By no means have I ever sought to violently harm any individual for any economic or political purpose. Nor have I ever been a member or even so much as condoned any militia or militant group(s). 

However, my mere existence and freedom is a sufficient blow to unscrupulous corporations and imperialist regimes like the British Crown who are promoters of slavery and colonialism.

## Background
To subdue my freedom and to silence me, on May 15th 2020 I was apprehended by Waterloo Regional Police (WRPS). I was arrested under false and slanderous charges written up on a "Form 2" by members of the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA). The Form 2 write up connoted that, "I am a violent person with psychosis and delusions who identifies with mercenaries and has had a history of dealing with militants."

This type of an allegation is strictly directed at demeaning, denigrating and dehumanizing me to justify crimes against my personhood. 

Upon being apprehended and committed to Grand River Hospital (GRH) psychiatry ward against my will, I was forcibly administered psychotropic drugs that had a contraindication to my existing medical history. The drugs forced into me harmed my neuro-endocrine and reproductive systems. Worst of all, the contraindication could have killed me from a thrombosis resulting in a stroke or cardiac arrest. 

Such bigoted and underhanded tactics used by members of CMHA in coordination with WRPS and GRH are a gross violation of authority provided to them through the Mental Health Act of the Ontario Government. In this regard I hold the following entities responsible for damages, harm and injustice inflicted upon me: 

  - the particular individuals involved, 
  - their affiliated institutions, 
  - the colleges and formal bodies providing accreditation to those institutions and
  - the government of Ontario under whose statutory laws, policies, acts and purview a prejudiced crime of this nature was committed.
  
## Plea for justice
Upon consulting with lawyers I was informed that to even bring my case forward to a court I would need upwards of $50,000 (fifty thousand dollars)! This is an exorbitant amount that I cannot afford. It is evident that the justice system is inaccessible to a person like me, who has suffered damages at the hands of various sister bodies of the government's justice department. The harm done to me in the recent months has exacerbated my health related challenges. For these reasons, I have been unable to earn a living and have been reduced to poverty and distress during an ongoing pandemic. 

Prior to the targeted neuro-chemical assault orchestrated against me via clinicians at CMHA and GRH, the federal agency called Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) was mucking around with my application for permanent residence in Canada. Due to IRCC's professional malfeasance and poor systems management my application continued to get delayed and put me through severe healthcare and financial trauma. The details of this separate issue are presented [here](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1vxBNXk_ffw8HbrJVsw5qO-67aSfVnEesnBqKvsk8Qko&font=Georgia-Helvetica&lang=en)

## Why now, why me
I believe these acts were committed against me due to my activism: 
  1. Investigating and highlighting corruption among S&P 500 corporations with identifiable names and aliases of their chief executive and chief financial officers.

  1. Excavating the corruption and misappropriation of tax monies in Kitchener-Waterloo Region by incumbent politicians and WRPS officials. This was in the context of a new police headquarters for $60 million at 200 Frederick Street, in Kitchener. By using a right of information application with the Kitchener City Hall I was able to prevent secret usurpation of a public building towards militarization of local police. My proposed use for the building in the cultural district of Kitchener is to align it with the Center in The Square as a diplomatic hub.

  1. Filing a police complaint with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) about cyber attacks that pillaged my medical data and proprietary intellectual property for cyber security software. My warning about similar attacks being conducted against Canadians at a persistent and increasing level were unheeded. This was months prior to the LifeLabs hack that has adversely impacted the privacy and security of millions of residents, visitors and newcomers to Canada. 
  
  1. Artistic expressions and social media activities highlighting the dehumanizing acts of the incumbent government:
